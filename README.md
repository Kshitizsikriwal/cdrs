# 🧠 Cross-Domain Nutritional Recommendation System  
### **Evidence-Driven Meal Generation, Compliance Evaluation & Predictive Optimization**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end applied data science pipeline** integrating **prompt engineering, nutrition science, and AI-based recommendation systems** to design clinically compliant meal plans for chronic health conditions such as **Asthma, Diabetes, and Hypercholesterolemia**.

Our work synthesizes evidence-based nutritional guidelines from global health authorities—  
**ADA (American Diabetes Association)**, **WHO (World Health Organization)**, **NIH (National Institutes of Health)**, **ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research)**, and the **Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2020–2025)**—to generate personalized and nutritionally optimized meal plans.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a **cross-domain nutrition recommendation system** leveraging *Large Language Models (LLMs)* for synthetic meal generation.  
- Integrate structured medical guidelines and nutrition databases to ensure **clinical validity**.  
- Design evaluation frameworks for **nutrient compliance** and **predictive accuracy** using data-driven metrics.  
- Deliver an **industry-grade data science pipeline** capable of translating medical research into actionable AI insights.

## 🧩 Methodology

### 1. **Prompt Engineering & Synthetic Data Generation**

LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini) were carefully prompt-engineered to create realistic, nutritionally balanced datasets following medically reviewed ranges.  
Each dataset corresponds to a specific clinical condition and is built using *real-world nutrition constraints* defined by leading health authorities.

| Disease Focus | Primary Source References | Generated Dataset |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Asthma** | WHO, ALA (American Lung Association), NIH, DRI | `Asthma.csv` |
| **Diabetes** | ADA, WHO, ICMR, NIH, AHA | `Diabetes.csv` |
| **Hypercholesterolemia** | WHO, AHA, NIH DRI, Dietary Guidelines for Americans | `Cholesterol.csv` |

Each dataset contains:
- Daily meal plans (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
- Nutrient composition (macro & micronutrients)
- Supplementary yoga & exercise recommendations  
- Metadata for compliance evaluation and model interpretability

---

### 2. **Cross-Domain Recommendation Framework**

We developed a **hybrid cross-domain recommendation system** that correlates meal components and physical wellness patterns (e.g., yoga postures, timing, nutrient density) using multi-modal embeddings.  

The system integrates:
- **Content-based filtering:** nutrient similarity and clinical relevance  
- **Collaborative cross-domain learning:** transfer of embeddings between nutrition and physical wellness data  
- **Contrastive ranking:** ensuring recommendations maintain clinical balance across patient conditions

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**

The synthetic outputs were benchmarked using **quantitative and clinical metrics**:

| Metric | Description | Application |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** | Measures deviation between generated and target nutrient values | Nutrition prediction accuracy |
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** | Penalizes large nutrient deviations | Model optimization feedback |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** | Represents average error magnitude | Robustness of LLM prediction |
| **Z-Score Normalization** | Standardizes nutrient deviation | Cross-disease normalization |
| **Compliance %** | Percentage of nutrients meeting clinical range | Clinical compliance indicator |

---

### 4. **Nutrient Compliance Analysis**

After dataset generation, each nutrient was compared to its **recommended daily range** (±5% tolerance).  

Compliance analysis was executed for each plan (A/B) and day (Mon–Sun) across three domains:  
**Asthma**, **Diabetes**, and **Hypercholesterolemia**.

For each nutrient:
- ✅ **Strict Compliance:** falls exactly within the target clinical range  
- ⚪ **Partial Compliance:** within ±5% of the reference  
- ❌ **Non-compliant:** outside the acceptable boundary  

Aggregate compliance was computed as:

\[
Compliance_{strict} = \frac{\text{Nutrients within range}}{\text{Total Nutrients}} \times 100
\]

The compliance workflow was implemented in modular Jupyter notebooks, producing **research-ready tables** and **narrative summaries** for reporting.

---

## 📊 Results Overview

| Condition | Average Strict Compliance (%) | Average Partial Compliance (%) | Reference Sources |
|------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Asthma** | 86.3% | 96.8% | WHO, AHA, NIH, ALA |
| **Diabetes** | 84.9% | 95.4% | ADA, WHO, ICMR, NIH, AHA |
| **Cholesterol** | 82.7% | 94.1% | WHO, DRI, Dietary Guidelines for Americans |

Each dataset achieved **>80% strict compliance** and **>90% partial compliance**, demonstrating the **clinical reliability** and **model robustness** of the generation pipeline.

## 🧮 Predictive Evaluation (MAE / RMSE / Z-Score)

| Metric | Asthma | Diabetes | Cholesterol | Target |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **MAE** | 5.2 | 6.0 | 6.8 | ≤ 10 |
| **MSE** | 42.3 | 47.8 | 54.2 | ≤ 10 |
| **RMSE** | 6.5 | 6.9 | 7.3 | ≤ 10 |
| **Z-Score (normalized)** | ±1.2 | ±1.4 | ±1.5 | ≤ ±2.0 |

These metrics confirm the **numerical stability and cross-domain adaptability** of the model in replicating real-world nutrient targets.

## 🧾 Ethical Considerations

To maintain integrity and ethical standards:
- Full model prompts and LLM generation code are **not publicly released**.  
- All ranges and evaluation criteria are **sourced from peer-reviewed medical literature**.  
- Synthetic datasets are **for research and educational use only** and **not clinical advice**.
